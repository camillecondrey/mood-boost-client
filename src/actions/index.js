            `<p>"It’s dark because you are trying too hard. 
                    Lightly child, lightly. Learn to do everything lightly. 
                    Yes, feel lightly even though you’re feeling deeply. 
                    Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with them.
                     Lightly, lightly – it’s the best advice ever given me. There are quicksands 
                     all about you, sucking at your feet, 
                     trying to suck you down into fear and self-pity and despair. 
                     That’s why you must walk so lightly. 
                    Lightly my darling" -Aldous Huxley</p>`
